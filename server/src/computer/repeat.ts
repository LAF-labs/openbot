 * A model that cannot get something to work retries. It clicks the same button, reloads the same
 * page, writes the same file, and every one of those attempts is a real action on somebody's live
 * website and a real charge against somebody's model credit. The trail records all thirty of them,
 * one row at a time, with nothing to say that they are the same row thirty times over, so nobody
 * notices until the other side's rate limiter does.
 *
 * This counts, and it does nothing else with the answer. The count goes to the policy, which is the
 * one thing in this codebase allowed to refuse an action. A detector that blocked on its own would
 * be a second boundary with rules of its own, invisible on the Boundaries page, unanswerable to
 * `dry-run`, and impossible to switch off for the one Bot whose job really is to poll something.
 * One boundary, given better information.
 *
 * IN MEMORY, which is the whole count: this deployment is one process on one VM
 * (docs/laf/deployment-model.md), so the process that served the call is the process that holds the
 * count. A `computer_repeat_calls`/`computer_repeat_reports` pair once stood beside this and was
 * what the server actually wired, justified by "several servers behind a load balancer each see a
 * fraction of a Bot's calls". They cost two DELETEs, an INSERT and a COUNT on every governed click
 * to answer a question a Map answers for nothing, and were deleted on 2026-09-02 by decision §7-1.
 * Git holds them; the decision record holds the list to start from if the deployment ever changes
 * shape.
 *
 * What the count is still wrong about is in `policy.ts` beside the field a rule reads: the caps
 * below, the sliding window, and the fact that only the computer gateway counts.

 * handed one action at a time by whichever route is serving the model, and nothing in that path
 * carries a turn boundary; inventing one would mean threading a conversation id through every acting
 * call to get a worse answer than a clock gives.
 *
 * Three minutes. A retry loop is a model round trip each time round — call the tool, read the
 * failure, decide to try again — which is seconds, not minutes, so ten identical attempts fit inside
 * this comfortably. Much longer and honest repetition starts to accumulate: a Bot told to watch a
 * dashboard reloads the same page all morning and is not stuck. Much shorter and a model that thinks

 * Full means full. A call the Bot has not made before is not counted, and nothing still inside the
 * window is dropped to make room for it, because dropping something is a guess at which key will not
 * come round again and the obvious guess is the one that fails hardest. Least recently seen is
 * exactly the key a Bot going round a long loop is about to make next, so a loop of more than this
 * many distinct calls would lose each key one step before it returned, and a Bot in a tight circle
 * would be reported as making every one of its calls for the first time.
 *
 * The cost is the Bot whose first sixty-four distinct calls are honest work and which only then gets
 * stuck: its loop is invisible until one of those sixty-four falls out of the window, which is at
 * most one window away. A blind spot that clears itself is worth more than an eviction rule that can

 * like one stuck on its first field, and the first person to see a rule fire on that would turn the
 * feature off. So the key is the tool plus the argument saying WHICH thing it acted on — the ref,
 * the key pressed, the file path, the address being opened — and a call carrying none of those is
 * not counted at all.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: the text being typed. A Bot that fills the same field thirty times is worth
 * catching, but what it filled it with is a password as often as it is anything else, and from here
 * the fingerprint travels into an audit row. The cost is that thirty different values into one field
 * read as thirty repeats, which is the direction to be wrong in.
 *
 * A ref only means anything against the snapshot it came from. A page that re-renders and hands back
 * a different ref for the same button reads as a different call, so a Bot looping around a reload is
 * undercounted. Keying on the element's label instead would follow the button across snapshots and
 * merge two buttons that share a label, and a count that is sometimes low is easier to live with
 * than one that is sometimes about the wrong thing.
 *
