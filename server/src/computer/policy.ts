/**
 * Whether a Bot may take one particular action on one particular page.
 *
 * Mirrors the policy engine in CopilotKit's enterprise agent gateway rather than being re-derived, so
 * a rule written here means the same thing there. Kept from it: CEL expressions, default-deny, and
 * fail-closed evaluation. Added here: a `deny` list, because an allow-only policy can only forbid one
 * thing by withdrawing permission from everything.
 *
 * DROPPED FROM IT: `dry-run`. It decided, recorded a refusal and let the action happen anyway, which
 * made it a second switch beside `settleWithoutAsking` that could stand the whole boundary down —
 * and the deployment this product ships to is one person's business, not an enterprise trying a rule
 * out against a quarter's traffic first. Everything enforces (docs/laf/redesign-2026-09.md §7-10).
 *
 * CEL instead of a rule table. The boundary a company wants is a sentence: "never click anything
 * that says Submit on a page outside our own domain". A table of columns can express the shapes we
 * thought of; an expression language can express the one they thought of. This is also the language
 * the enterprise gateway already speaks, so a rule written here means the same thing there.
 *
 * Precedence: deny, then ask, then allow. A rule that removes permission must never be
 * defeated by a broader rule that grants it, or a company cannot reason about what it has forbidden.
 *
 * `ask` sits between the two, and both halves of that position are deliberate. It must not soften a
 * `deny`, because a thing a deployment has forbidden is not up for renegotiation at a prompt, and an
 * approval box in front of a tired person at the end of a task is not the review anybody signed off
 * when they wrote the deny rule. And it must beat `allow`, because the policy this product ships with
 * is `allow: ["true"]`: an ask evaluated after the allow list would be unreachable in the default
 * configuration, so the first rule anybody ever wrote here would silently do nothing.

   * Over, once, and that one costs somebody their Bot rather than their evidence. Two calls are the
