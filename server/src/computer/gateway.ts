/**
 * The only way an action reaches a Bot's computer.
 *
 * Reading a page is one thing; clicking a button on an external website is
 * another, and the difference is the whole product. The record is not a report written alongside the
 * work, it is the thing the action goes through, so it cannot be missing: an action that was not
 * recorded did not happen, because there is no path that acts without writing the row first.
 *
 * Three jobs, in this order:
 *
 *  1. Resolve the ref the caller sent into the element it actually points at, from the snapshot this
 *     server fetched. Never from what the caller said it was clicking.
 *  2. Ask the policy. Deny beats allow, an absent policy denies, and a broken rule denies.
 *  3. Write the row, whichever way the decision went, and only then act.
 *
 * Step 1 is the one that is easy to skip and fatal to skip. A gateway that decides on a label supplied
 * by the model is theatre: "never click Submit" is evaded by sending `{ref: "e13", name: "Continue"}`.
 * The refs are opaque to the caller precisely so that the server holds the mapping.
