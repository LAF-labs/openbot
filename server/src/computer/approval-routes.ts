 * servers, an `ask` rule written about those is the shape operators reach for first, "ask me before
 * anything changes anything in Jira", and a deployment that runs plugins without a browser would
 * otherwise raise questions on a surface it never mounted: the Bot would sit for the full ten
 * minutes and then report that nobody answered, having never asked anybody.
 *
 * Answering is a person acting, so it is audited as one, under their own actor and against the thing
 * the question was about rather than against whatever endpoint they happened to press the button on.
 * The row is written here, next to the answer, because these two handlers are the only place in the
 * product where consent is recorded and a second place would eventually record it differently.
