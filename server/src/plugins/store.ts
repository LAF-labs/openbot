       * Every field is present, including the ones a tool call has no use for, and that is load
       * bearing rather than tidy. This engine treats an expression it cannot evaluate as a match,
       * which is correct for a browser action on an element the server could not resolve. Applied to
       * a tool call it is a disaster: the boundary this product ships in `.env.example` denies
       * `contains(element.name, "submit") || key == "Enter"`, and with `element` and `key` absent
       * that rule is unevaluable, so it would match, so every deployment using the shipped preset
       * would refuse every MCP call for a reason mentioning a submit button.
       *
       * Neutral values instead. Empty strings match no substring, no key and no extension, and
       * `submit` is false because a tool call submits no form, so a rule written about the browser
       * evaluates to false against a tool call, which is the honest answer: a tool call did not click
       * anything. A rule meant to catch tool calls says so, with `mcp` or with `intent`.
       *
       * The blanks are for the policy engine and never for a person: the sentence a question is
       * phrased in reads them as absent rather than as an empty file path, or somebody would be
       * asked to approve "The Bot wants to call ."
