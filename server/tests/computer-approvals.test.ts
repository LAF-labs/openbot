/**
 * What an approval has to mean, tested as properties rather than as a call sequence.
 *
 * A registry that only remembered ids would pass a naive test and be worthless: the failure it
 * exists to prevent is a person allowing one thing and a model spending that permission on another,
 * and nothing about that is visible from a green typecheck. So the cases here are the four ways a
 * grant can be stretched beyond what somebody agreed to, plus the two ways it stops being valid.
