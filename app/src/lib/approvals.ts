 * The questions a boundary raised, from the browser's side: reading them, answering them, and

 *
 * One module for all of it because the two halves have to agree. A tool call that met an `ask` rule
 * holds itself open waiting for an answer, and the card a person answers on is drawn on that same
 * tool call's line in the transcript. Those are different components on different render passes, so
 * the id travels through here.
 *
 * A question is held against the tool call that raised it rather than against the Bot. The Bot's
 * list is the wrong key: nothing withdraws a question when the wait around it ends, so pressing
 * Stop, reloading the tab or a turn that errors all leave an unanswered entry sitting in the
 * server's registry until it expires. A card that showed "the oldest thing this Bot is waiting on"
 * would then put a stale question in front of somebody on an unrelated line, record their Allow
 * against an action nobody is waiting for, and leave the action they were actually looking at
 * waiting out the full ten minutes.
