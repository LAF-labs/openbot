/**
 * A transcript line that grew two buttons, for the one action a boundary wanted a person to see.
 *
 * Not a modal, and the restraint is the point. A question about one click belongs where the click is
 * being reported, in sequence with everything else the Bot did, so a person can see what led up to it
 * without losing the conversation behind a dialog. A boundary that interrupts the whole screen is one
 * people learn to dismiss, and an ask rule that gets reflexively approved is worse than no rule at
 * all: it produces a record of consent that nobody actually gave.
 *
 * It draws the question its own tool call is waiting on, and nothing else. The alternative, asking
 * the server what this Bot is waiting on and showing the first unanswered thing, cannot tell one
 * question from another: a run that was stopped or a tab that was reloaded leaves its question open
 * in the registry for the rest of the ten minutes, so the card would offer somebody a stale question
 * on the line of an action nobody is being asked about, and record their Allow against the wrong
 * one. The tool call that raised the question is the only thing that knows which one is its own, so
 * it is what says so.
