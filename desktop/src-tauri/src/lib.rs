//! The installable shell around the cloud service.
//!
//! A window onto the deployed origin, and nothing the browser tab did not already do. The product's
//! engine runs on the server — the Bots, their virtual computers, the room turns — and this process
//! exists so the person gets what a tab cannot give them: an icon in the dock, a window that is
//! theirs, notifications that arrive with the window closed behind other apps, and updates that
//! install themselves. It deliberately holds no product logic, because every line here is a line
//! that has to be written twice once there is a phone app.
//!
//! THE ORIGIN IS A SETTING, NOT A CONSTANT. The SPA is same-origin by construction: cookie auth,
//! relative `/api` calls, a socket built from `window.location`. Loading it from `tauri://` would
//! break every one of those at once, so the window navigates to the origin and the app runs there,
//! exactly as it does in a browser. Today that origin is the development server; the day a deployed
//! address exists it is one value in `tauri.conf.json`, and the same value is what a phone will use.
